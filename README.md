- 👋 Hi, I’m @HandyHarley
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics, data science, programming (R, Python, Java, C#) and LP/NLP.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying statistics at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland. I am working with my Master's thesis about the use of Bayesian random effect models in large scale tunnel maintenance allocation. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any field that might be suitable for my background.
